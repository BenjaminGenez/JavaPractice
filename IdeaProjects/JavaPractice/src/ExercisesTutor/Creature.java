/**Exercise: Creature Hierarchy
 Background:
 Imagine a world with different types of creatures. Each creature has its own characteristics and behaviors.

 Task:
 Create a Base Class:

 Name it Creature.
 Define common attributes like name (String) and age (int).
 Include a constructor to initialize these attributes.
 Add getters and setters for each attribute (encapsulation in action!).
 Inheritance:

 Create two subclasses of Creature named Bird and Mammal.
 For Bird, add an attribute wingSpan (double).
 For Mammal, add an attribute furColor (String).
 Each subclass should have its own constructor to initialize its specific attributes along with the inherited ones.
 Implement getters and setters for new attributes.
 Unique Behaviors:

 In Bird, add a method fly() that prints something like "Flapping wings and flying!".
 In Mammal, add a method run() that prints something like "Running on the ground!".
 Control Flow in Main Method:

 Create a main method in another class.
 Instantiate a Bird and a Mammal.
 Use control flow (if-else) to check the type of each created object.
 If it's a Bird, call the fly() method.
 If it's a Mammal, call the run() method.
 Bonus:

 Add a method in Creature called displayInfo() which prints out the creature's details.
 Override this method in both Bird and Mammal to include their specific attributes.
 Objectives:
 Practice using constructors for object initialization.
 Understand inheritance and how subclass constructors relate to base class constructors.
 Apply encapsulation with private attributes and public getters/setters.
 Implement control flow to execute methods based on object type.
 Bonus: Get a grip on method overriding.
 This exercise will give you a well-rounded practice session on these concepts. And remember,
 if your creatures start behaving oddly, it's probably just a bug in the matrix, nothing a little debugging can't fix!
